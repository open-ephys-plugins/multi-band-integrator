/* The multi-band integrator allows the user to take a weighted sum of up to 3 frequency bands and apply a rolling average to build a power signal for complex waveforms with well-defined spectral properties. It was initially developed to detect absence-like seizures in real time from EEG recorded in awake, head-fixed mice. The user sets the duration of the rolling window and input channel, as well as frequency ranges and gains that define the waveform of interest. The processed signal is output on the same channel as the input channel. Two adjacent channels are overwritten with the initial raw input channel and the weighted summed signal before averaging to allow the user to fine-tune frequency ranges and gains on a per-animal basis.
 
 Because channels are overwritten, I recommend using a split path in Open Ephys. One of the split paths includes the seizure detector followed by an LFP viewer to show how the input channel is being filtered. The other contains a second LFP viewer to show all of the channels without any multi-band integrator processing.
 
 This plugin can be used with the third party crossing detector plugin to trigger events based on the processed output from the multi-band integrator.*/
